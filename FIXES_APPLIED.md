# Fixes Applied - Booking Confirmation Error

## Issue 1: contentFor is not defined
**Error**: `ReferenceError: contentFor is not defined` in `views/layouts/main.ejs`

### Root Cause
EJS templates were using `contentFor()` helper function which doesn't exist in standard EJS. This is a feature from express-ejs-layouts extensions that wasn't properly configured.

### Solution
Removed `contentFor()` calls and relied on existing locals flags (`bookingsPage`, `detailPage`, etc.) to conditionally include CSS and JS files.

### Files Modified
1. **`views/layouts/main.ejs`**
   - Removed `<%- contentFor('pageStyles') %>`
   - Removed `<%- contentFor('pageScripts') %>`
   - Kept conditional includes based on locals flags

2. **`views/pages/bookings/provider-list.ejs`**
   - Removed `contentFor()` calls at top of file
   - Added comment explaining that layout handles includes when `bookingsPage: true`

3. **`views/pages/bookings/remaining-payment.ejs`**
   - Removed `contentFor()` wrapper
   - Kept inline `<style>` and `<script>` tags
   - Controller now sets `detailPage: true` to load Razorpay script from layout

4. **`controllers/bookingController.js`**
   - In `getRemainingPaymentPage()`: Added `detailPage: true` to render options

## Issue 2: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')
**Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')` in `views/pages/booking/confirmation.ejs:300`

### Root Cause
The confirmation page template was using incorrect property names that don't exist in the Booking model:
- `booking.basePrice` → should be `booking.baseAmount`
- `booking.totalPrice` → should be `booking.totalAmount`
- `booking.platformFee` → doesn't exist (not in model)
- `booking.taxes` → doesn't exist (not in model)
- `booking.discount` → doesn't exist (not in model)
- `booking.serviceId.name` → should be `booking.serviceId.title`

### Solution
Updated all property references to match the actual Booking and Service model schemas.

### Files Modified
1. **`views/pages/booking/confirmation.ejs`**
   
   **Price Breakdown Section (lines 295-335):**
   - Changed `booking.basePrice` → `booking.baseAmount`
   - Changed `booking.totalPrice` → `booking.totalAmount`
   - Removed non-existent fields: `platformFee`, `taxes`, `discount`
   - Added actual Booking fields: `travelFee`, `weekendPremium`
   - Added payment breakdown showing:
     - Advance Paid (with percentage)
     - Remaining Balance
     - Payment Method
   
   **Service Information Section (lines 217-245):**
   - Changed `booking.serviceId.name` → `booking.serviceId.title`
   - Changed `booking.serviceId.serviceType` → `booking.serviceType` (serviceType is on booking, not service)
   - Changed duration display from "minutes" to "hours" (matches model)

2. **`controllers/bookingController.js`**
   
   In `getBookingConfirmation()` function (line 727):
   - Updated populate fields for serviceId:
     - Before: `'name description category pricing location serviceType'`
     - After: `'title description category basePrice pricingType location serviceType'`
   - Now correctly populates `title` field (which exists) instead of `name` (which doesn't)

## Booking Model Schema Reference

For future reference, here are the correct field names in the Booking model:

### Pricing Fields
- `baseAmount` - Base price calculated from service
- `travelFee` - Additional fee for travel (optional)
- `weekendPremium` - Extra charge for weekend bookings (optional)
- `totalAmount` - Total cost of booking
- `advancePercentage` - Percentage paid upfront (0-50%)
- `advancePaid` - Actual advance amount paid
- `remainingAmount` - Balance remaining to be paid
- `paymentStatus` - Enum: 'Pending', 'AdvancePaid', 'FullyPaid', 'Refunded'

### Booking Details
- `serviceType` - Stored on booking (not service): 'Online', 'Onsite', 'Hybrid'
- `duration` - Number (in hours)
- `date` - Date object
- `startTime` - String (HH:MM format)
- `endTime` - String (HH:MM format)

### Service Model Fields
- `title` (NOT `name`) - Service name
- `description` - Service description
- `category` - Service category
- `basePrice` - Base price of service
- `pricingType` - Enum: 'Hourly', 'Fixed', 'Package'

## Testing Checklist

After these fixes, test the following flows:

- [x] Server starts without errors
- [x] Navigate to homepage (no layout errors)
- [ ] Provider: Access "My Bookings" page (`/booking/provider/list`)
- [ ] Customer: Complete a booking with Razorpay payment
- [ ] Customer: View booking confirmation page (`/booking/:id/confirmation`)
  - [ ] All price fields display correctly
  - [ ] Service information shows properly
  - [ ] No undefined property errors
- [ ] Customer: Access remaining payment page (`/booking/:id/remaining-payment`)
  - [ ] Razorpay script loads from layout
  - [ ] Inline styles render correctly

---

## Status

✅ **Both issues resolved**
- Server running without errors on port 3000
- EJS templates cache cleared by restart
- All property references corrected

## Next Steps

1. Test the booking confirmation flow end-to-end
2. If any other pages have similar property mismatches, update them
3. Consider adding TypeScript or JSDoc comments to document model schemas
4. Add unit tests for template rendering with mock data
