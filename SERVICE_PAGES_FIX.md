# Quick Fix Applied - Service Pages Working Now

## What Was Fixed

The service management pages (`add.ejs`, `edit.ejs`, `my-services.ejs`) were trying to manually include the layout, but Express already applies the layout automatically through the view engine settings.

### Files Fixed:
1. `views/pages/services/add.ejs` - Removed layout include
2. `views/pages/services/edit.ejs` - Removed layout include  
3. `views/pages/services/my-services.ejs` - Removed layout include

## How to Access Service Pages Now

### Prerequisites
You MUST be logged in as a **Saheli (Service Provider)** to access these routes.

### Step-by-Step Testing:

#### 1. Create a Saheli Account (if you don't have one)

```
Visit: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup

- Select "Service Provider" as role
- Fill in details:
  - Name: Test Saheli
  - Email: saheli@test.com
  - Password: Test@123
  - City: Mumbai
- Click "Sign Up"
- Enter OTP from console/email
- Complete signup
```

#### 2. Login as Saheli

```
Visit: http://localhost:3000/auth/login

- Enter email and password
- OR use OTP login
- You should be redirected to dashboard
```

#### 3. Access Service Routes

Now these routes should work:

**Add Service:**
```
http://localhost:3000/services/add
```
- Should show "Add New Service" form
- All fields visible (title, category, pricing, etc.)
- Image upload section
- Submit button

**My Services:**
```
http://localhost:3000/services/my
```
- Shows all your created services
- Filter buttons (All, Active, Paused)
- Sort dropdown
- Service cards with Edit/Delete actions

**Edit Service (after creating one):**
```
http://localhost:3000/services/:id/edit
```
- Pre-filled form with existing service data
- Can update all fields
- Image management

## If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Are you logged in?
```
Open browser console (F12)
Check cookies - should have "connect.sid" cookie
```

### Check 2: Is your role "Saheli"?
```
These routes require role: 'Saheli'
Customer accounts cannot access service management
```

### Check 3: Server running?
```
Terminal should show:
"Server is running on port 3000"
"MongoDB Connected"
No error messages
```

## Create Your First Service
